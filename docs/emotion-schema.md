# Emotion Schema

This document defines the core emotional categories used in the Psyche system.  
To ensure consistency in tracking and analysis, all emotional data across the system should be based on this standardized list.  
By limiting inputs to a small set of well-defined, fundamental emotions, we make meaningful tracking and automated analysis possible — avoiding the confusion and fragmentation caused by open-ended emotion input.

## Guiding Principles

- **Only Include Fundamental Emotions**: Each emotion listed should be irreducible — not composed of more basic emotional states.
- **Avoid Synonyms**: There should be only one label per emotional experience to maintain consistency and avoid redundancy.
- **Objective, Without Intensity**: Descriptions should define the emotional quality without implying intensity, severity, or valence.
